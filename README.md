# REWE e-Bon Categorizer

This is a simple python-script for the console that reads and parses a REWE e-Bon (PDF format) and categorizes the items.  
The user has the ability to edit the (automatic) categorization from the console.  
  
Used categories for bought items can be saved into a local JSON-based configuration so that future executions will take these assignments into account.  
  
This is helpful for users that want to add bought items into a housekeeping book (i.e. Finanzguru) or some other applications.
